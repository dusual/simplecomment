README for sphinx-simplecomment
=================

The Project
===========

The project is inspired by django book and hg book. It allows us 
to comment on sphinx documentation. 

Installing
==========
Add the html files of SPHINX PROJECT in setting at the variable SPHINX_PROJECT

do

python manage.py syncdb
python manage runserver

You will have to change the local_settings file according to you own requirements.


Installing using Apache
=======================


Do

python manage.py syncdb before these steps so that you get a db
to work with.

Install mod_wsgi

Put the path of the wsgi file in your Apache configuration file

For me it was /etc/apache2/sites-available/default like this:

    WSGIScriptAlias / /home/home/simplecomment/sphinx_django/runonapache.wsgi

To be able to read and write to the database under apache you have to
change the ownership of the sphinx_django folder to www-data or
whatever user apache is running.

Apart from that there is a local_settings file with which you can
manage difference between development and production server. I will
love to see the changes in this file so that i can abstract out more
differences between developement and production server.

As a sample local_settings file is commited as part of the first
commit. But may not remain as we refine this project.
